# mc-js-proxy
A JavaScript proxy for Minecraft  
This is a project I made just for fun, please do not expect perfect support etc...
## You can use it to:
* Debug/Log packets
* Spawn copies of yourself that for example have a bigger x coordinate
* Do other cool stuff
## Planned:
* Session passthrough
* Chat control (ex: `proxy connect kbpw.de`)
* Fixing Timeout issues
* Fixing issues with packet's
* Allowing more people to use the proxy
## How to use it:
* `git clone https://github.com/JuCeLoDE/mc-js-proxy/`
* `npm i`
* `node index.js <host> <port> <version>`
